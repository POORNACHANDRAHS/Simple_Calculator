### Project Name: Simple Calculator in Java

#### Description

The **Simple Calculator** is a command-line application developed in Java, offering a straightforward yet efficient way to perform basic arithmetic operations. Designed for ease of use, this calculator handles common mathematical functions, providing accurate results with a user-friendly interface. 

#### Features:

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Perform fundamental operations with ease:
  - Addition (`+`)
  - Subtraction (`-`)
  - Multiplication (`*`)
  - Division (`/`)
  - Modulus (`%`)
  
- **User Input**: The program prompts users to input two numbers and select the desired operation, ensuring a seamless calculation experience.
  
- **Input Validation**: Robust error handling is built in to manage division or modulus by zero, preventing runtime errors and providing clear error messages to guide the user.
  
- **Looping Structure**: The calculator runs in a continuous loop, allowing users to execute multiple calculations within the same session. Users can conveniently exit the program by entering '0' as the operator.
  
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling is in place to manage invalid operator inputs and protect against divide-by-zero errors, ensuring the program runs smoothly.

#### How to Use:

1. Run the program.
2. Enter two numbers when prompted.
3. Select the desired arithmetic operation by inputting the corresponding operator.
4. View the result of the operation.
5. Continue performing calculations or enter '0' to exit the program.

#### Technologies Used:

- **Java**: Core programming language used to build the application.
- **Java Scanner Class**: Utilized for capturing user input, ensuring interactive and dynamic functionality.

This project is ideal for users seeking a reliable tool to perform everyday arithmetic tasks efficiently, wrapped in a simple and accessible Java application.

Conclusion: This project serves as a basic example of using Java for simple mathematical calculations.
